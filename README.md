# Project Title: Car Sales Analysis

In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of car sales data to derive meaningful insights and create an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel. Below are the key steps and techniques I employed:

# Data Cleaning and Transformation

Data Import and Inspection:
Imported raw car sales data into Excel and performed initial inspection to understand the dataset structure and identify any inconsistencies.

# Handling Missing Values
Identified missing values and used techniques such as imputation and deletion to address them, ensuring the dataset was complete and ready for analysis.

# Data Normalization
Standardized various data fields to ensure consistency. This included converting date formats, normalizing text cases, and ensuring numerical data was appropriately formatted.

# Removing Duplicates 
Checked for and removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
Data Analysis

# Descriptive Statistics
 Calculated key statistics such as mean, median, and mode to summarize the central tendencies of the data.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Utilized pivot tables to explore different dimensions of the data, uncovering patterns and trends such as sales distribution by region, vehicle type, and sales periods.

# Trend Analysis
Analyzed sales trends over time to identify peak sales periods and patterns in consumer behavior.
Pivot Tables and Charts

# Dynamic Pivot Tables 
Created pivot tables to dynamically slice and dice the data, allowing for flexible analysis and drill-downs into specific areas of interest.

Interactive Charts: Developed various charts, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, to visually represent the data and highlight key insights.

# Dashboard Visualization

Dashboard Design: Designed a user-friendly and interactive dashboard that consolidates key metrics and visualizations, providing a holistic view of the car sales data.

# Interactivity
Incorporated interactive elements such as slicers and filters, enabling users to customize their view and interact with the data in real-time.

I never underated the power of Microsoft Excel - this tool is powerful!! ðŸ“Š ðŸ’•
